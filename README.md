# Creating a project

`NodeJS required`

```sh

cd <name of the project>
```

# Visualizing the app

```sh
expo start
```

> On your phone, download the Expo App, then flash the QR code on your computer with it.
> Your phone and computer have to be on the same network so `make sure there's no VPN or stuffs like this`

# The render method

Every React component should have a render method.
This one will automatically be called whenever the component should be display.
It uses JSX to express what should be displayed.

# Notes

- I'm using a OnePlus 6 for this tutorial which is an Android smartphone with a Notch ; While not applying CSS to my component, the natural behaviour is that the text of the component for instance is at the top of the screen. `The Notch is covering up some part of the text !`
